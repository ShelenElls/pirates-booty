07/12:
just discovered the project advice on the learn because it was NOT available to us last week. 
All this morning we spent re-working the project and setting it up correctly. 

07/13:
spent the day working on setting up the models, forms, settings, and admin.
got base user fields set up for the model to create with a username, email, name and passwords. 
still need model forms to show aspects for pirate coins as well as a VO

07/14:
plan is to create a vo model to poll data from workouts, finish urls to verify the back end works via insomnia. the user model will have a class method that add's coins to the users profile via an onclick handler on the react pages.
