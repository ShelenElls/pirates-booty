Today I worked on:

*Checking in with my team to ensure we were all on the same page and we resolved a few bugs. Coordinated with Alex to get the API endpoints to pass my data to the wheel spinner. Agreed to check in with the rest of the team after lunch before pushing the changes that would allow me to access the database. My plan is to start working on the code to fetch the data and then implement once everyone is ready. I also started the dashboard page that will display all the different components of our app.

Today I worked on:

*Walked through the details of our app with the team. We changed the design of the spin wheel so that it only displays treasure chests instead of the individual body parts. We also determined that we want the leader-boards page and pirate booty page to be in the same page instead of separate pages. In addition we are adding a page to display the workout once its clicked. I also worked with Zynh on implementing the spinner wheel and he talked me through the logic.

Today I worked on:

* Trying to get my spinning wheel to work. I have been looking through what other people have done and trying to pick a wheel that I can modify. I have started and tried several different ones without success.

Today I worked on:

* A bug with my react-router-dom. It kept saying the module had not been found. My team helped me work through the issue. Today I also focused on making the spinner wheel work. I initially found code for one I liked and it turned out to be more complicated than I thought. So I looked for a different sample that seems much easier to implement.

Today I worked on:

* A bug with my ghi. I was having a hard time getting the container to start up in docker. Went through several web pages trying to look for the answer as well as worked with my team.

Today I worked on:

* Talking to my group and deciding what everyone was going to work on. I am doing Main Page. js and working on the spinner page.
