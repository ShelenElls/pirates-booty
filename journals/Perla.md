## August 3, 2022
Today I worked on:
* React unit testing. I am still having trouble getting my testing to work. I spent many hours scouring documentation of all types and even consulted a SEIR with no luck. However, I did start a new React project and was able to get a sample test to pass, so I will be using that as a reference and as a source for debugging. 

## August 2, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Starting a new branch for my work because yesterday I encountered errors with my code. Last night I encountered errors with my code, and I was trying to resolve them. However, when I brought this up tp the team, Shelen had also encountered the same errors and resolved them by creating a new personal branch. Now that I have everything working again I will be working n a test unit. 



## August 1, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Cleaning up some of the formatting of the components on the front end. The spinning wheel is off center and some of the background is not fully loading all the way. My goals for today are also to start the unit test and figure out how to make that work. 


## July 28, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Having my workouts list view have the ability to click on the name of a workout and have it bring up the workout gif. 


## July 27, 2022
Today I worked on:
 *Consulting the team on my Workouts List. I showed them my code and they helped to walk me through all the pieces and how they worked together. I realized that part of the problem was that I was unsure about where the data I was passing in was coming from and this helped to clarify a lot of my coding hiccups.Im going to review all my code and figure out where I can clean up commented out code that I wont be using or extra files that are unnecessary.  


## July 26, 2022
Today I worked on:
*Trying to get my Workouts List View to work. I actually ended up reading through a lot of documentation and looking at examples. I dont know what was happening today but it seemed like I had a coding mental block all day. I have a lot of pieces of my component but getting a little lost on how to put them all together. Tomorrow I will check in with my team or a SEIR. 


## July 25, 2022
Today I worked on:
*Today we went over all the components that were left to work on. One of those components was a list view of all the workout and that is what I will be working on today. 


## July 22, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Today was a day where I worked on small changes on the project. Our worked stalled a bit because we had trouble with our authentication and users. We were able to get help from Curtis and we got it working at the end of the day. 

## July 21, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Fixing different bugs that several team members were having. Alex and Shelen were having trouble downloading some dependency files and getting their React Wheel to render correctly. I was trying to fix something in my code and ended up having to revert to a previous commit to get everything up and running. I got part of the code up and running for the react wheel to display data and Alex helped me finish implementing it yesterday. Today I will be working on the Nav bar.  


## July 20, 2022
Today I worked on:
* Adding the second spinner wheel to the wheel spinner page. As a team we all worked on going through some bugs some of the group was having getting their react wheel spinner dependencies to install. We determined we will have to add some documentation about this in order to prevent users from running into the same issues. I will also work on implementing passing data into the wheel spinner and researching how to limit wheel spins in the main page.  


## July 19, 2022
Today I worked on:
* The Dashboard file and making sure that the format matched the previous pages. Will be checking in with Ting to ensure we are on the same page in terms of what that page will look like. 



## July 18, 2022
Today I worked on:

*Checking in with my team to ensure we were all on the same page and we resolved a few bugs. Coordinated with Alex to get the API endpoints to pass my data to the wheel spinner. Agreed to check in with the rest of the team after lunch before pushing the changes that would allow me to access the database. My plan is to start working on the code to fetch the data and then implement once everyone is ready. I also started the dashboard page that will display all the different components of our app.  

## Jul 15, 2022
Today I worked on:

*Walked through the details of our app with the team. We changed the design of the spin wheel so that it only displays treasure chests instead of the individual body parts. We also determined that we want the leader-boards page and pirate booty page to be in the same page instead of separate pages. In addition we are adding a page to display the workout once its clicked. I also worked with Zynh on implementing the spinner wheel and he talked me through the logic.  


## July 14, 2022
Today I worked on:

* Trying to get my spinning wheel to work. I have been looking through what other people have done and trying to pick a wheel that I can modify. I have started and tried several different ones without success. 




## July 13, 2022
Today I worked on:

* A bug with my react-router-dom. It kept saying the module had not been found. My team helped me work through the issue. Today I also focused on making the spinner wheel work. I initially found code for one I liked and it turned out to be more complicated than I thought. So I looked for a different sample that seems much easier to implement. 


## July 12, 2022
Today I worked on:

* A bug with my ghi. I was having a hard time getting the container to start up in docker. Went through several web pages trying to look for the answer as well as worked with my team.


## July 11, 2022

Today I worked on:

* Talking to my group and deciding what everyone was going to work on. I am doing Main Page. js and working on the spinner page.
