- fixed docker/database/yml file issues
- trouble when trying to run the GET/POST requests in Insomnia due to error of 
"Connection refused. Is the server running on host 'postgres' (172.26.0.4) and accepting
TCP/IP connections on port 5432" (reason likely because system shutdown unexpectedly).Finally fixed it by running Stack Overflow commands: postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres, and kill -9 PID.
