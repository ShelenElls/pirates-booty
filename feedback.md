## Dalonte 6/7

from Slack:

Good Afternoon!  Very clever concept.  I'm eager to see the end product and would like the group to consider additional features/concepts as 'stretch' functionality. (Meaning if time allows you'd implement the additional functionality, this exercise will allow you to really flush out the user's story)   
- Pls try to identify any 3rd party API's you plan to use as soon as possible.  
- Pls consider non-registered-user functionality, if applicable
